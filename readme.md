# 📊 Age vs Height Prediction – Regression Model

This project applies **Machine Learning Regression models** to predict a person's **height** based on their **age**.  
Different regression techniques were tested (Linear & Nonlinear), and the most accurate model was selected for final deployment using **Streamlit**.

## ✨ Features
- 📂 Dataset: Age vs Height  
- 📈 Model Comparison: **Linear Regression** vs **Nonlinear Regression**  
- ✅ Selected the best performing model based on accuracy metrics  
- 🎛️ Interactive **Streamlit app** for predictions  
- 🔍 Includes **Data Analysis & Visualization**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Regression models & evaluation  
- **Streamlit** – Web app for deployment  

---

## 📂 Workflow
1. **Data Analysis**  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Age vs Height dataset.  
   - Visualized trends between features.  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Implemented **Linear Regression**.  
   - Tested **Nonlinear Regression** approaches.  
   - Compared accuracy & performance.  

3. **Deployment**  
   - Best model integrated into a **Streamlit app**.  
   - Users can input **Age** to predict **Height**.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
  1. Clone this repository:
     ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/age_vs_height_simple_LR.git
       cd age_vs_height_simple_LR
    ```

  2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
     venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```

  3. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  4. Run the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run main.py
    ```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Try advanced regression models (Polynomial, SVR, Random Forest).
- Add model performance comparison plots in the UI
- Deploy on cloud platforms (Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS).
